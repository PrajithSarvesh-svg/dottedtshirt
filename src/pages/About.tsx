      <p>
        Dotted was born from a simple belief: the best wardrobe starts with a perfect t-shirt.
        We stripped away everything unnecessary and focused on one thing — creating the essential tee
        you'll reach for every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every piece is crafted from 100% organic cotton, garment-dyed for rich, lasting color.
        Our relaxed, contemporary silhouettes are designed to feel as good as they look, with
        reinforced seams and pre-washed fabric that only gets softer with time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We produce in small batches to reduce waste, partner with ethical manufacturers, and
        ship in recyclable packaging. Because doing less, better, is always the right choice.
